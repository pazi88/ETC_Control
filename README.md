# ETC_Control

if you send a 1 it will force the throttle fully open, then force it fully closed, and record all tps values as max, min, and resting (since ETCs are driven backwards too)

send a 2 and it will ask you to calibrate the throttle. you have about 2 seconds to respond to the command.

3 activates serial diagnostics, it tells you all input values every 500 or so ms

4 burns the calibration to memory

5 clears the calibration for reason i don't know why

6 changes the relationship between the APP and TPS resulting position

7 shuts down limp mode if it was trigger, it doesn't inhibit it

8 tells you if the CRC is ok

9+ do nothing lol
